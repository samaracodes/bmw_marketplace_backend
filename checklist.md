2/6 
----------------
progress:
- controller setup for users/listings/sessions/category/listing_category
- serializer setup for all of the above
- cors changed to localhost:3001, enabled cookies
- sessions routes implemented
- upgraded rails/ruby versions 

// pending //
- listing needs to inherit listing_categories
** thoughts: it would be easier to keep the listings and part listings as separate objects. **
